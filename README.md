# Sparkify with Apache Spark Mllib & Data Science
Manipulate large and realistic datasets with Spark to engineer relevant features for predicting churn. 
Use Spark MLlib to build machine learning models with large datasets.


### ** Purpose **

Predicting churn rates is a challenging and common problem that data scientists and analysts regularly encounter in any customer-facing business. 

Additionally, the ability to efficiently manipulate large datasets with Spark is one of the highest-demand skills in the field of data.

### ** Essential Skills **

1. Load large datasets into Spark and manipulate them using Spark SQL and Spark Dataframes

2. Use the machine learning APIs within Spark ML to build and tune models

3. Apply Data Science techniques on the Spark data set


### ** Overview **

Sparkify is a cloud music streaming service just like Spotify or Pandora. 

We are provided the user log of the of the service.

The user log contains demographic information, user activities, timestamps, whether user is a paid or free tier, and etc. 

I have built a log and modeling to identify customers who are highly likely to quit using our service (Customer Churn). 

We can incorpoate the findings to launch a A/B test to build a recommendation engine to keep these users more engaged, and as well as pass them to the marketing team to engage these users with mails about thier favorite songs and offer them suscription discounts.

I have computed F1 scores to measure of model performance based on precision and recall. 

The F1 score will guide us to predict more precisely the users who are likely to churn, thus taking Sparkify towards growth.
